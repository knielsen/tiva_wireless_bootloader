Simple bootloader to allow flashing over nRF24L01+ wireless.

This is especially intended to allow easy development of POV
applications, where it is rather inconvenient to have to stop the
motor, connect debug cables, flash, disconnect, start up again in
every compile iteration.

The bootloader sits at address 0, waits a short while for bootloader
trafic on wireless, and if so downloads the image and flashes
it. After it moves the interrupt vector to where the real application
sits and starts it like a normal reset.

Thus, the target application must be compiled at the proper offset,
rather than address 0.
